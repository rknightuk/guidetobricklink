## Adding the parts to a wanted list

<div class="alert alert-warning"> 
To get an idea of how much a set will cost you to part out, go to <a class=".alert-link" href="http://www.bricklink.com/catalogPG.asp">Catalog > Price Guide</a> and use the "Part Out Value" form on the left. Enter a set number, choose new or used parts, and select which extras to include (instructions, box, extra parts).

To part out a set, go to [Wanted > Part Set](http://www.bricklink.com/wantedSet.asp), and input the set number. A number of options are available here such as including minifigures and instructions, as well as adding the parts to an existing or new wanted list. It recommended to check the box *Set My Minimum Desired Qty for each Item to Qty of Items in Inventory* so that the required quantity will be added to the parts. Default remarks will set that remark for each item â€” this is particularly useful if you want to add the parts to a list which already has parts in it.

    title="Parts Edit"

%}

The next step allows for changing quantities, deleting parts you don't want to add, and adding remarks to specific parts; the final setop is simply for confirming the parts you are going to add to the list.
