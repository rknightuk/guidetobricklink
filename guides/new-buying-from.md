Click on the name of the store and the store page will open, showing the store terms in a modal (see below). This is where the seller will outline any specific rules they have for their store (for example, some stores have rules about the minimum price of each "lot" — these stores can be a pain to order from). Also outlined here will be minimum order quantities, which countries they ship to, and shipping costs. It should be noted that not all stores will list shipping costs here, but most sellers will tell you if you contact them. If you are not happy with the rules outlined here either contact the seller to see if better terms can be negotiated, or choose another seller.

Once the store terms have been closed, the sidebar on the left will show your wanted lists, how many parts are on it, and how many parts from that list the store has. Other wanted lists will also show here — this can be helpful when deciding which store to order from when two have the same amount of parts needed. The column on the right will show all parts the store has from the checked wanted list, including the quantity available, condition, and price.

At the top of the right column are some options to auto-fill the shopping cart: min and max. Minimum will fill the quantity inputs to match the quantity from the wanted list. Maximum will set the quantity to match the quantity available from the seller — this is more useful when ordering bulk lots of items, rather than set quantities for a specific set. Be aware that many sellers will have the same item in new and used conditions (and sometimes multiple used conditions) so when auto-filling it's best to review the quantities before adding them to the shopping cart.
