To find out if a store has parts from your wanted lists, click <kbd>Show All Items this store has on my Wanted List</kbd> from the left sidebar. This will show everything the store has from all your wanted lists; to check a specific one, choose it from the dropdown and click <kbd>Go</kbd>.

The categories on the left hand side are split into multiple sections including: sets, parts, minifigures, instructions, and also colour. Clicking on any of these will show you all parts in the selected category; if you're looking to make up your order so it reaches the minimum order quantity, this is a great way to find some random parts to buy (I generally buy some extra minifigure parts in my orders). This is also useful if you know what *kind* of parts you want to buy; choose the category, and check out everything the seller has.

Before checking out, click on the <kbd>Splash</kbd> tab at the top of that page; this page outlines any rules about ordering the seller might have, as well as an estimate of how long an order might take to process. The <kbd>Store Terms</kbd> usually shows which countries the seller ships to, estimated shipping costs, and minimum order details. For some stores, the terms and splash page are identical. It should be noted that not all stores will list shipping costs here, but most sellers will tell you if you contact them. If you are not happy with the rules outlined here either contact the seller to see if better terms can be negotiated, or choose another seller.

{{TIP}} At this stage, some sellers have a option to request a quote. If a quote is requested the seller will send a quote for shipping for the parts, which can then be ordered at the quoted price. However, if someone else buys those parts before a quote is accepted, they will no longer be available. A seller is under no obligation to hold a quoted order for you.

When you're happy with the items in your shopping cart, click <kbd>Checkout</kbd> at the top of the sidebar, and then click <kbd>Proceed to Checkout</kbd>. On this page, sellers will list all the currencies and payment methods they accept for you to choose from. Some sellers will also have postage options to choose from. A note an be added to an order which the seller will see when they are notified about the order. Finally, the sellers terms will be shown here, which should be reviewed before pressing <kbd>Complete Purchase</kbd>.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
Once a purchase is complete, clicking on <kbd>Modify Items in Wanted List</kbd> will show you all the parts from the order that are in a wanted list. This allows you to delete order parts from the list so you don't accidently order duplicates in subsequent orders. This can also be done at any time by going to <a class="alert-link" href="https://www.bricklink.com/wantedDetail.asp?orderID=12345">https://www.bricklink.com/wantedDetail.asp?orderID=12345</a> replacing `12345` with the order number.
