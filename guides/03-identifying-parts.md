Finding parts in the Bricklink catalog can be daunting, but there are a number of ways to identify and find parts on Bricklink.

<div class="alert alert-warning"> 
When you've identified a part, you can find out price information by clicking on the <kbd>Price Guide</kbd> tab below the part information and selecting a colour (if you haven't already). This will show you prices for new and used versions of the part over the last six months, and the current items for sale on BrickLink.
</div>

## Find Parts

### By Part Number

If you already have one the parts you want to order, the part number can be found in a couple of different ways:

- Printed on the part: Many lego parts have the element or design ID printed on them (albiet really small). For example, tires generally have the part number printed on the side.
- Instruction manuals: Most recent instruction manuals have a list of parts and their design ID in the back pages

### By Set

If you know of a set that includes the part, search for that set on Bricklink and then click the link to view the parts list underneath <kbd>Item Consists of</kbd>.

### By Name or Description

Size is always a good place is start when trying to identify a peice. For example, the piece below is 2 studs by 2 studs in size, and round. Search for `2x2 round` on Bricklink will return a number of results, and about halfway down the list is this part.

    title="Part 4032"

%}

If a part is printed, search by that as a keyword. For example, if a part is printed with a phone design, search for "phone" and the size of the part.

### By Category

If you know the category of a part, go to [Catalog > View](http://www.bricklink.com/catalog.asp), and choose the category from the <kbd>Parts</kbd> dropdown. You can also search with category, colour, year, and keywords from [Catalog > Search](http://www.bricklink.com/catalogSearch.asp). The parts shown below are in the [Brick, Modified](http://www.bricklink.com/catalogList.asp?catID=7) and [Plate, Modified](http://www.bricklink.com/catalogList.asp?catType=P&catID=27) categories, respectively.

### By Colour

If all of the above haven't worked, searching by colour can also work. Select the colour from the colour dropdown on [Catalog > Search](http://www.bricklink.com/catalogSearch.asp). This might seem overwhelming at first, as the results can be pretty long, but for a part that isn't one of the standard colours (white, black, red, etc) this method will ensure you'll find the part you're looking for. Choose <kbd>List with Images</kbd> or <kbd>Thumbnail Gallery</kbd> and this will show the results with images of the parts.

## Find Minifigures

### By Colour and Description

The colour method listed above works for finding minifigures and by description can also be useful; the minifigure below can be found by the following keywords (individually or combined):

- `jacket`
- `gray`
- `scarf`
- `magenta`
- `blue`

{%include image.html
    title="Minifigure 'TWN236'"
    url="assets/images/minifigure-scarf-jacket.jpg"
%}

### By Theme

If you know the theme a minifigure is from, go to [Catalog > View](http://www.bricklink.com/catalog.asp) and choose the category from the dropdown. Some themes, like Star Wars or Superheroes, have multiple themes associated with them, so you may need to go through a few different searches to find the minifgure you're looking for.
