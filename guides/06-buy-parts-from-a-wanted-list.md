## Finding a store with the most parts

### The Manual Way

<div class="alert alert-warning">
You can limit stores to specific countries or regions by going to <a class="alert-link" href="http://www.bricklink.com/wantedSettings.asp">Wanted > My Settings</a> and choosing a country or region.
</div>

To find stores with the most amount of parts from a wanted list, go to [Wanted > By Shop](http://www.bricklink.com/wantedShop.asp), choose your wanted list from the dropdown, set the <kbd>sort by</kbd> dropdown to <kbd>Lots (Unique)</kbd>, and press <kbd>go</kbd>. This will then show all stores that have the parts in the wanted list, in descending order. It's worth noting that if you require two of a specific part and a store only has one, Bricklink won't reflect this in the sorted list.

In the example below, the first store has all but four of the parts needed to purchase everything in the wanted list. At this stage there are two options:

1. Buy the 54 parts from that store and then repeat the process for the remaining four parts (Note: this may not be the most cost-efficient method depending on shipping costs for the last four parts).
2. Use a tool like Brickficiency to find the most cost-effective way of buying all the parts.

If you want to find a store with the most parts from multiple wanted lists, click <kbd>Show Multiple Selections</kbd> in the top right; you can then select multiple wanted lists to query from.

To find stores with a subset of parts from a wanted list, choose the wanted list from [Wanted > Wanted List](http://www.bricklink.com/wantedView.asp), click <kbd>edit only</kbd>, and check the boxes in the <kbd>Query Shops</kbd> column. Click <kbd>Submit Changes</kbd> and Bricklink will show the store list based only on the selected parts.

## Adding parts to your shopping cart

<div class="alert alert-warning">
If you haven't already, read <a class="alert-link" href="/trustworthy-sellers">how to know if a seller is trustworthy</a>. tl;dr: Look for sellers with a high percentage of positive feedback.
</div>

Click on the name of the store and the store page will open, showing all of the parts that the store has from the wanted list. Above the list of parts are some options to auto-fill the shopping cart: <kbd>Auto-Fill Cart Max</kbd> and <kbd>Auto-Fill Cart Min</kbd>. Minimum will fill the quantity inputs to match the quantity from the wanted list. Maximum will set the quantity to match the quantity available from the seller â€” this is more useful when ordering bulk lots of items, rather than set quantities for a specific set. Be aware that many sellers will have the same item in new and used conditions (and sometimes multiple used conditions) so when auto-filling it's best to review the quantities before adding them to the shopping cart. When you've reviewing the quantities, click <kbd>Add Selected Items to Shopping Cart</kbd> at the bottom of the list.
