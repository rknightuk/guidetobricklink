Bricklink allows you to add notes to a store and set them as your most or least favourite seller. To do this, go to a store's page and click <kbd>Add to My Favourite Stores</kbd>. Then choose most or least favourite, or subscribed from the dropdown, add any comments you want, and click <kbd>Add Store</kbd>. Here you can choose to subcribe to a store announcements, (although in my experience most stores don't use this feature) by checking the <kbd>I want to receive announcements from this store</kbd> option.

<div class="alert alert-warning"> 
You can also manage your favourite stores by going to <a class="alert-link" href="http://www.bricklink.com/pref_favorite.asp">Buy > My Favourites</a>.

By adding a store as a most or least favourite, a star will show next to the store in search results (see below). This allows you to easily find stores you like when trying to buy parts from a wanted list. Additionally, if you go to [Wanted > My Settings](http://www.bricklink.com/wantedSettings.asp) you can exclude your least favourite stores from showing up in search results.
