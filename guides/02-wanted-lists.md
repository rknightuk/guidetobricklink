The best way to buy what you need from Bricklink is wanted lists. Wanted lists are lists of parts, minifigures, sets and insructions that you want to buy. By default, a Bricklink account always has at least one wanted list; the "Main" wanted list.

<div class="alert alert-warning">

</div>

A part on a wanted list has four data points to it:

- Condition: New, Used, or either.
- Max price: The Maximum you are willing to pay for the part
- Minimum quantity: The quantity you want of that specific part. This will show up next to the part in a store.
- Remarks: Remarks are a note that shows up when looking at which parts a store has from your wanted list.

## Finding Wanted List Parts in a Store

If you want to find only <kbd>some</kbd> of the part in a list, you can check the <kbd>Query Shops</kbd> checkbox and press <kbd>Submit Changes</kbd> to show a list of stores that have those specific parts.

<div class="alert alert-warning">

</div>

## Creating and deleting

To create a wanted list go to [Wanted > My Wanted List](http://www.bricklink.com/wantedView.asp), add a wanted list name in the form on the right and click <kbd>Add New Wanted List</kbd>.

To delete a list, select the checkbox next to the list. To update the name, simply change the name in the input box. After either of these actions press <kbd>Submit changes</kbd>. Deleting a wanted list cannot be undone.

## Adding Parts to a Wanted List

To add a part to your wanted list, go to the part's information page by searching by part number or description (view our guide on [identifying parts here](/how-to-identify-parts)), condition, and press "Add to Wanted List" to view the add form.

{% include image.html 
    title="Add to Wanted List"
    url="ximages/add-to-wanted-list.jpg"
%}

{% include image.html 
    title="Add to Wanted List Form"
    url="ximages/add-to-wanted-list-form.jpg"
%}

On the form, choose a colour (if you didn't choose one on the information page), the wanted list you want to add it to, add a quantity, any remarks you want to add, and then press <kbd>Add Item</kbd>.

From this form, you can check the <kbd>Notify Me by Email</kbd> checkbox, in conjuction with the two checkboxes above, to receive an email when that part becomes available in any store.

<div class="alert alert-warning"> 
This form is also available by going to <a class="alert-link" href="http://www.bricklink.com/wantedAdd.asp">Wanted > Add Item</a> and choosing a category. However, I have found this method much more tedious than using the search.
</div>

## Moving, Deleting and Updating parts

Go to [Wanted > My Wanted List](http://www.bricklink.com/wantedView.asp) and you'll see a list of categories for all the parts in your wanted list. To update or delete the parts, press <kbd>Edit Only</kbd> or <kbd>Show All</kbd> and this will show all the parts. From here, you can update remarks, condition, price and quantity, as well as moving them to another list or deleting them.

To delete a part, select the checkbox underneath the delete column next to the part, and press <kbd>Submit Changes</kbd>. To move a part, follow the same process but with the <kbd>Move</kbd> column, choose wanted list to move it to, and press <kbd>Submit Changes</kbd>.

You can move or delete parts en masse by checking the relevant box at the top of the table, which will select all parts in the list.
