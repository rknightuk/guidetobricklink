The best way to buy what you need from Bricklink is wanted lists. Wanted lists are lists of parts, minifigures, sets and instructions that you want to buy. By default, a Bricklink account always has at least one wanted list; the "Default" wanted list.

<div class="alert alert-warning">

</div>

A part on a wanted list has four data points to it:

- Condition: New, Used, or either.
- Max price: The Maximum you are willing to pay for the part
- Wanted quantity: The quantity you want of that specific part. This will show up next to the part in a store.
- Remarks: Remarks are a note that shows up when looking at which parts a store has from your wanted list.

## Finding Wanted List Parts in a Store

If you want to find only *some* of the part in a list, on the [wanted list page](http://www.bricklink.com/wantedView.asp), you can check the checkbox to the left of an item and press <kbd>Buy X Selected</kbd> to show a list of stores that have those specific parts.

</div>

## Creating and deleting

To create a wanted list go to [Want > My Wanted List](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/wanted/list.page) from the top navigation bar, click <kbd>+ Create New Wanted List</kbd> and choose a name and optional description. To delete a list, select <kbd>Delete</kbd> next to the list on the wanted list page.

## Adding Parts to a Wanted List

To add a part to your wanted list, go to the part's information page by searching by part number or description (view our guide on [identifying parts here](/how-to-identify-parts)), condition, and press "Add to Wanted List" to view the add form.

%}

{% include image.html
    title="Add to Wanted List Form"
    url="assets/images/add-to-wanted-list-form.jpg"
%}

On the form, choose a wanted list from the left hand side, colour (if you didn't choose one on the information page), add a quantity, any remarks you want to add, if you want to be notified by email when the part is available, and then press <kbd>Add to Wanted List</kbd>.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
This form is also available by navigating to a wanted list and selected <kbd>Add Item</kbd> However, I have found this method much more tedious than using the search.
</div>

## Moving, Deleting and Updating parts

Go to [Want > Wanted List](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/wanted/list.page) and you'll see a list of categories for all the parts in your wanted list on the left, and all of your lists on the right. Either select a category or click on a wanted list to view the items you've added. From here you can update remarks, quantities or delete items.

To manage multiple parts, use the checkboxes next to each item and then use the top menu to move, copy, or delete parts. You can also sort lists by color, condition, price, quantity, or remark using the filters at the top.
