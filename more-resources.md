## Other places I buy from

- [The Minifigure Store](http://www.theminifigurestore.co.uk?affiliates=18)
    + Sells inidividual minifigures and polybags, and complete sets of CMFs.
- [Brick Owl](http://www.brickowl.com/)
    + Similar to Bricklink, but has fewer sellers and parts available.
- [eBay](http://ebay.co.uk)
    + Prices tend to be higher than Bricklink, but sometimes has items not available elsewhere.
- [Amazon](http://amazon.co.uk)
    + Mostly for sets rather than separate minifigures, Amazon almost always have sets for lower than the retail price.
- [Camel Camel Camel](http://uk.camelcamelcamel.com/)
    +Use this site to set up alerts for when a set reaches a specific price point on Amazon.
